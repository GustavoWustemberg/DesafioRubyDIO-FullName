The objective of the challenge was to create a program in the Ruby language that outputs the user's full name and age.

## Didactics:
You need to create a simple reader access program
in a library and for that the user must type his
name and surname, in addition to your age, which is a given
relevant to the marketing department at that location.
All this, in print, in a single sentence.
